# Semantic Markup Exercise

To get started, fork and clone this repository.

The `index.html` document is marked up with many `<div>` and `<span>` tags. Examine their content and change them to semantic HTML tags.

Once you're finished, check your HTML document for errors with the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
